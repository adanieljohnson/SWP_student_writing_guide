# (PART) Preface {-}
# Welcome! {-}

Many undergraduate biology courses require lab reports and other types of __scientific writing.__ This genre is different from technical writing, which is the style we see in instruction manuals. Scientific writing is what scientists do every day when they create articles for publication, summarize work they have done for their employer, when they apply for grant funding for their research, and even (less formally) when they write up observations in a lab notebook. Scientific writing is very closely connected with other kinds of __scientific communication__ like oral presentations and scientific posters because the thinking and methods we use to share information are very similar.

Formal scientific communication is very different from what most students have done in the past. It is organized in a very specific way and follows particular rules and conventions. In this Guide we will focus on how to build a report that models a journal article. We're doing that because most parts of a lab report also are found in other kinds of scientific communication. For example, once you learn how to organize the Introduction to a lab report, you pretty much know how to organize the background section of an oral presentation. Making data figures is another example; the same figure formats used in a lab report could be used in a journal article, oral presentation, or poster.


## How This Guide Is Organized {-}

Part 1 is a high-level look at what makes scientific writing distinctive, and how it is organized to meet its goals. We explain how to read scientific literature, because reading articles in a field is the fastest way to understand the standards and conventions authors follow in that field. 

Part 2 shows how hypotheses and experimental design are connected to scientific writing. Readers learn how to turn questions about the world around us into testable hypotheses, and how to design an experiment that provides reliable data to start answering those questions. 

Part 3 focuses specifically on scientific articles and lab reports for biology. We show what goes in each section, point out where our own students struggle with each section, and suggest ways to avoid common pitfalls. 

Part 4 shows how to summarize, analyze, and present the data collected during experiments. We include a basic guide to statistical analysis, with links to more detailed sources of information.

Part 5 explains how to use outside sources to support reports, and how to cite sources accurately.

Part 6 helps writers start building a "writer's toolbox." We show how to build sound arguments, and assess writing, thinking, and logic more critically. 

Part 7 has Resources for Instructors. It may not be part of the student version of the Guide.

The Appendices contain practice cases with examples of lab reports written using the materials in the case files.


## Why Create Another Writing Guide? {-}

There are plenty of books available already that explain how to organize and format scientific writing. This Guide goes beyond the "what is needed" and "how to do X" steps of writing, and explains some of the "why." As teaching faculty in large introductory biology courses we have watched a lot of students go through the process of learning to communicate like scientists. One frustration we hear over and over is "why do we have to do it this way? Why can't I do it the way I learned before in (put any course you like here)?" We've found that, when we explain some of the logic or reasons behind elements of scientific writing, then the format and rules make sense and are easier to follow. 

We also will point out when there may be differences in opinion. Often these mean you have to do things slightly differently for particular instructors or courses. For example, the correct format to use when citing sources is a common (and often heated) point of disagreement. In these situations we will provide what we know to be sound advice and our reasons, but you should follow the guidelines your instructor provides if they differ from ours.

We've learned that sometimes overly strict rules actually get in the way of learning to write like a scientist. For instance, some writing guides still insist that all sentences end with two spaces before the next sentence. This rule is left over from the days of manual typewriters. We think it is silly to lower a student's grade for a missing space if typing skills are not what their teacher is trying to develop. In this Guide we try to avoid repeating rules and requirements that are not essential to learning to write well. 

Finally, we will suggest free tools and resources that can help you avoid problems altogether. Going back to citing sources, academic literatures uses 8000+ different citation formats. Rather than learn the details of whether semi-colons should be italicized after the journal names (but not after book names) for a particular citation format, we suggest using Zotero or some other citation manager to do that for you. 

In the end, we want you as a scientific writer to feel confident that you know WHAT your goals are, WHY those goals are important, and HOW to get there. Who knows? You may find that you have a hidden talent for it, on which you can build a career. Yet even if you never come to enjoy scientific writing, learning to do it well now will pay off regardless of where your professional path takes you.


## Why Make Our Guide an Open Online Book? {-}

Having an online book means we can make it freely available to all students and teachers. Being web-based also solves a problem with any guide book: not everyone has the same rules and requirements for writing assignments. Instructors can copy and modify this book to fit their requirements using free open-source software, then share it their students.  


## Who Are We? {-}
This Guide was created as part of the __STEM Writing Project__ at Wake Forest University. We are STEM teachers and education researchers who want to make scientific writing a bigger part of students' training. Scientific writing assignments are hard to manage in large introductory classes, and hard to evaluate systematically. This Writing Guide is one of many tools we are developing to help STEM teachers solve this challenge.
