# Title and Abstract

Even though they are at the front of a report or article, these should be the last parts of the report that you write. You need to know what you have said in the main text before you know what to put in the abstract. Similarly, you need to know what the most important finding of your experiment is before you can write a meaningful title.


## Title

Your title should clearly communicate your topic to readers, what organisms are being studied (ideally, with scientific names), the biological property or system being studied, the particular stimulus, stress, or situation that is being applied to the system, and briefly what was found. 

At the same time your title should be clear, concise, and assertive. Imagine you have to pick an article to read and present to the class. You have looked at 30 other article titles already, and none sound appealing. You come to the last two choices. Based just on their titles, which of these 2 articles sounds like one you would want to read?

	\#31: Study of the Effects of Feline Dripomazoloid Derivative Compounds on Involuntary Caudal Motor Behavior in Canine Communication
	\#32: Dripomazoloids Extracted From Cat Hair Trigger Dog Tail Wagging

If your title is more than 2 typed lines, it probably is long and should be shortened.

## Abstract

The abstract is a summary of your entire report. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study’s main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study’s background, the methods, major results, and conclusions.  

You should not include references in your abstract. Any information you have in the abstract should be in the body of the text too. Citing the source of that information in the main text is sufficient. 

Even though it is usually at the front of a report or available before a presentation, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written.

Your instructor may not want you to include an abstract for your lab reports. If you are unsure, ask.
