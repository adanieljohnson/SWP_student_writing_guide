# Discussion

The Discussion section is where you interpret your results and explain what they mean. This section also is where you relate your results back to the larger body of scientific knowledge. By the end of the Discussion section, you should be talking in general, broad terms once again. Be careful not to get too broad though; your experiment is not the explanation for everything. 

These are the questions your should try to answer in the Discussion.

1. Did your results support your hypothesis?
2. What is your biological explanation for why the manipulation you made produced the results you observed?
3. How do your findings connect back to the information in your Introduction?
4. How do your results and your explanation or interpretation compare with previously published studies?
5. How do your results increase our understanding of the world around us?


## Other Tips

You should refer to published primary literature; it provides the supporting context for how you interpreted the results. Cite these sources as you use them in your work (using in-text citiations). 

If you have evidence of an error in your experiment, say so, but do not make up possible sources of error if you do not think they actually occurred. 

If appropriate, describe the alternative explanations of your data. If there is another possible explanation for your data, what future experiments are needed to determine the best explanation?

What is the next logical step for this study? Modify the procedure and repeat it? Try again, to increase the number of replicates with the existing methods? Test an entirely new hypothesis? Are there different methods or procedures you would use if you repeated the study again? 


## Examples of Poorly Written Discussion Sections

### Disorganized, No Clear Line of Reasoning


### No References to Connect Study to Larger Story


### Overly Broad Conclusions or Relevance


### Ignores the Results


### Inappropriate Sources of Error
