# Who & What is Scientific Writing For? {-}

The rest of this Guide details how to organize and create a lab report or other form of scientific communication. This kind of writing is very different from what most students have done in the past. Before we dive in, let's look at the bigger picture and talk about what __goal__ the writer hopes to accomplish (and how they get there), and the __assumptions__ about the audience.

## Scientific Writing Has a Specific Goal {-}
The goal of scientific writing is to make an argument which convinces readers that the writer is asking an important (or at least interesting) question, and has found a possible answer to the original question.

Usually the writer starts by introducing their question. It can be their own question, a problem that many scientists working in the field know about, or an observation that cannot be explained by the current understanding within the field. The writer provides some context for thinking about the question, usually by describing (and citing) what others have seen and said. 

Next, if the writer has conducted any new research studies, they will outline what methods and materials they used, providing enough detail for readers to judge whether or not their results can be considered reliable, and report what they observed. Writing that includes new studies is what we call __primary literature__. Writing that summarizes what others have written or done without doing new studies is what we call __secondary literature__, or __review literature__. 

In the next part, the writer makes one or more claims related to that question, then provides evidence to support the claim(s). The evidence can be data collected from a series of experiments, a logically reasoned argument, something that someone else published in the past, or some other trustworthy source of information. This step is when the writer actually tries to show they have found a possible answer to the original question. It also is when a good writer will outline the potential limitations of their own argument, and lay out new questions to think about.


## Scientific Writing Makes Assumptions About the Audience {-}
Scientific writing starts with the assumption that its readers are scientists working in the same or a closely related field. Each field has its own vocabulary, accepted styles and formats for sharing information. Authors assume their readers know the conventions of their field, including how and where important information is located in written work. Authors also assume their readers know certain general background concepts in their field. If the readers do not, they assume their readers will look for that background on their own. 

This is why so many students just starting out as science writers struggle at first: they don't yet know this assumed knowledge. They are not alone; even long-time scientists can find it hard to switch to a new field. Fortunately, there is a way to learn the conventions and assumptions of any field, which is to read published work from that field. Instead of looking at what the scientific arguments or conclusions are though, look at how it is structured. How is information organized and presented? What is assumed prior knowledge? Look at multiple examples from the field: what vocabulary terms come up repeatedly? Answering these questions will uncover many of the assumptions that the author is making.
