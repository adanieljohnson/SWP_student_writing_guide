# (PART) Your Writer's Toolbox {-}
# What's In Your Toolbox? {#toolbox600}

Up to now we've focused more on the "what goes where" mechanics of scientific writing. We find that most students get accustomed to these parts of the writing process pretty quickly, and after writing and revising 1-2 reports, they know what is expected and where to put it.

In this Section we will start adding some new tools and skills to your writer's toolbox. We will explain how to build stronger, well-reasoned arguments, and how to use arguments to assess your own and others' writing, thinking, and logic more critically. You will learn how to approach your writing tasks more strategically. Finally you will learn how to use peer review to improve your own writing, and help other students improve theirs.
