# (PART) Instructor Resources {-}
# The Instructor Toolbox {#teachertools700}

Part 7 of the Resource Guide is intended for Instructors. It can be removed from the student edition of the Resource Guide with no loss of content. Topics included here are:

* Bins-based lab report grading.
* Using reflective coaching to comment on student reports.
* Strategies for training GTAs to teach scientific writing.
*  An annotated Bibliography for those interested in going deeper.

Appendices A-C are practice cases that instructors can use for training activities or for teaching students to write lab reports when they do not have access to labs.
