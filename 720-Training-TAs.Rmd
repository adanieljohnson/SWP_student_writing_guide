# Training Teaching Assistants {#tatraining720}

In our program, undergraduate lab reports are graded by GTAs who direct the lab sections, not faculty. This creates some added challenges. First, the majority of our novice GTAs have not graded student work before. They bring a variety of past experiences, biases, and misonceptions with them when they join our program. Even seasoned GTAs can bring confounding preconceptions from their previous schools, or try to incorporate writing conventions that are specific to their research field. Second, many GTAs have limited scientific reading and writing experience themselves, so may have less confidence in their ability to judge the work of others who are close to their own age. To compensate, they may focus on obvious mechanical and formatting errors, citation punctuation, and similar items that can be corrected by copy-editing. 

To help GTAs internalize our goals, we have 3 training activities for TAs. 

* Explicitly train GTAs to follow our grading criteria. GTA training includes orientation and practice sessions, and round-robin grading, where new and experienced GTAs grade the same pre-selected set of reports, then discuss discrepancies in scoring. [This is explained elsewhere.](#commenting710)



In addition to grading students fairly, we want our GTAs to internalize best practices for teaching scientific writing as part of their professional development.  

To help GTAs internalize our goals, we have 3 training activities for TAs. 
1.	Annotating text excerpts. This is the same activity that students do. TAs do it to learn what questions their students might have, what data the annotation activity provides, and how to adjust the general writing workshop to address student misconceptions.
2.	Marking up previously graded reports. Before grading the first time, TAs are given a set of training reports and asked to grade them using our bins-based scoring. After grading, TAs will discuss their scores and comments with experienced graders during a lab prep meeting.
3.	Round-robin scoring. TAs select 4 reports from the first set of the semester, score them, then pass the 4 reports to another TA who also scores them. Scores and discrepancies are discussed in the next lab prep meeting.





One of our highest priorities when we train GTAs is ensuring they grade students fairly, and that GTAs give similar scores for work of similar quality (i.e., they have good inter-grader reliability.) We also want students to get actionable feedback that helps them grow as writers. Finally, we want TAs to spend their grading time efficiently. 

To accomplish those goals, we:

* Use __bins scoring__. This grading strategy is based on Linda Nilson's _Specifications Grading_. Briefly, we limit the number of items used for scoring reports, and only score those items on a binary scale (present/absent, yes/no, etc.)  This part of our process is explained below.
* Give students feedback a manageable number of comments in the form of __reflective coaching__. [This is explained elsewhere.](#commenting710)
* Encourage all graders to refer back to specific sections of this Resource Guide instead of writing out their own recommendations.
