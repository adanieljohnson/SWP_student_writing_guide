# Science Writing Vocabulary {-}

There are many words and phrases with very specific meanings in STEM fields. Some of these terms are unique to STEM. For example, it would be very unusual to hear someone use the phrase "positive control" in daily conversation. In STEM (especially in biology), this phrase has a very specific meaning.

Other terms have different meaning in general conversation vs. STEM fields. One of the big ones is "theory," which in general conversation is used to describe an idea or educated guess for how something works. In STEM fields, theory is the name for a rigorously and repeatedly tested principle that describes how the world around us operates. Another example is the word "significant." In general conversation this means something seems important. For scientists, it means the differences between two or more groups has been evaluated using one or more statistical tests, and the test indicates tha the two groups are probably not different just due to random chance. The word "significant" is so loaded for scientists that most will never use it in their writing EXCEPT when describing the results of statistical tests.
