# Checklist for Success {#submissioncheck650}

This general checklist follows the bins-based criteria that we use routinely. Your instructor will revise this checklist to match their expectations. 


## Minimum Requirements {-}
These fundamental elements __cannot__ be left out of a lab report.

[ &nbsp; ] All the required sections are present (Title, Abstract, Introduction, etc.) and properly organized.

[ &nbsp; ] Your report has a clear hypothesis, or clearly stated research goals.

[ &nbsp; ] Your data are summarized in figures or tables that are clear and informative.

[ &nbsp; ] You have interpreted your results, and stated clearly whether or not your original hypothesis was supported and why.

[ &nbsp; ] You have supporting citations for primary literature in your Introduction and Discussion. 

[ &nbsp; ] All of the sources you used are listed in the Literature Cited section. 


## Writing Quality {-}

[ &nbsp; ] Your wording is clear and concise. 

[ &nbsp; ] The text flows logically from one idea to the next.

[ &nbsp; ] You used precise, technical language and terms that are appropriate for a scientific audience.

[ &nbsp; ] You did not use "emotional" or unnecessarily complex language. 

[ &nbsp; ] You have not included any distracting elements that detract from clearly undertanding the outcomes of your experiment.


## Technical Elements {-}

[ &nbsp; ] All of your data have been summarized appropriately. You have not reported raw data or observations. 

[ &nbsp; ] Your tables and graphs are formatted properly and are clear, legible.

[ &nbsp; ] You have performed your statistical calculations correctly, and reported the results in the right format.

[ &nbsp; ] Your in-text citations are formatted correctly, and are all listed in the Literature Cited section correctly.

[ &nbsp; ] You have included references in the main text to every table or figure.



## Logic and Reasoning {-}

[ &nbsp; ] All of your claims are supported either by outside sources (which are cited) or by the evidence you collected and presented.

[ &nbsp; ] There is a clear, logical connection between each of your claims and the evidence supporting it. 

[ &nbsp; ] When it is not obvious, you have explained your reasoning connecting your claims and evidence.

[ &nbsp; ] You have interpreted the evidence conservatively, and not made claims or statements beyond what your evidence can support.

[ &nbsp; ] If you make any speculations, you indicate them clearly and explain your logic fully.


## Common Mistakes {-}
These are what we see __our__ students do. Your instructor will provide you with a list of what they see most often.

[ &nbsp; ] Making broad sweeping claims that are not supported by their evidence.

[ &nbsp; ] Not explaining their evidence or logic behind their claims.

[ &nbsp; ] Not using enough outside resources to put their experiment into context or support their conclusions.

[ &nbsp; ] Reporting or interpreting results of statistical tests incorrectly.

[ &nbsp; ] Putting error bars on graphs incorrectly, or not at all.

[ &nbsp; ] Reporting raw, un-summarized data.

[ &nbsp; ] Obscuring their story with elaborate, flowerly language and jargon.

[ &nbsp; ] Copying the methods straight from the lab manual.

[ &nbsp; ] Guessing what the instructor wants instead of asking for help.

[ &nbsp; ] Starting too late. Good writing takes time.
