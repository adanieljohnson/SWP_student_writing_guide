# (PART) Your Writer's Toolbox {-}
# What's In YOUR Toolbox? {#toolbox600}

Up to now we've focused mostly on the "what goes where" mechanics of scientific writing. We find most students get accustomed to those parts of the writing process pretty quickly. After writing and revising 1-2 reports, they know what is expected and where to put it.

In this Section we will start refining the basic tools that you have assembled so far. We also will add some new tools and skills to your writer's toolbox. We will explain how to build sound arguments, then use those principles to assess your own and others' writing, thinking, and logic more critically. You will learn:

* How to approach the task of writing more strategically;
* How to structure a good argument, and evaluate the arguments of others;
* How to use peer review to improve your own writing, and help other students improve theirs.
