# (PART) Your Writer's Toolbox {-}
# What's In Your Toolbox?

Up to now we've focused mostly on the "what goes where" mechanics of scientific writing. In this Section we're going to step back from the nuts and bolts of writing and show you how to build sound arguments, then assess your own and others' writing, thinking, and logic more critically. Think of this Section as a set of tools that you can use to build and refine the parts we have already explored.
