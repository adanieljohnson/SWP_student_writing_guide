"],["welcome.html", "Welcome! Why Create Another Writing Guide?", " Welcome! Many undergraduate biology courses require lab reports and other types of scientific writing. This genre is different from technical writing, which is the style we see in instruction manuals. It is the kind of writing that scientists do every day when they create articles for publication, write reports that summarize work they have done for their employer, when they apply for grant funding for their research, and even (less formally) when they write up observations in a lab notebook. Scientific writing is very closely connected with oral scientific presentations and posters, which we collectively call scientific communication. Formal scientific communication is very different from what most students have done in the past. This kind of communication is organized in a very specific way and follows particular rules and conventions. In this Guide we will focus on how to build a report that models a journal article. We’re doing that because most components of a lab report are used in other kinds of scientific communication too. For example, once you learn how to organize the Introduction to a lab report, you pretty much know how to organize the background section of an oral presentation. Making data figures is another example; the same figures used in a lab report could be used in a journal article, oral presentation, or poster. Why Create Another Writing Guide? There are plenty of books available already that explain how to organize and format scientific writing. This Guide goes beyond the “what is needed” and “how to do X” steps of writing, and explains some of the “why.” As teaching faculty in large introductory biology courses we watch many students go through the process of learning to communicate like scientists. A common frustration we hear over and over is “why do we have to do it this way? Why can’t I do it the way I learned before in (put any course you like here)?” We’ve found that, when we explain some of the logic or reasons behind elements of scientific writing, then the format and rules make sense and are easier to follow. We’ve also learned that sometimes overly strict rules actually get in the way of learning to write like a scientist. In this Guide we try to avoid repeating rules and requirements that are not central to learning to write well. For instance, some guides still insist that all sentences end with two spaces before the next sentence. This rule is left over from the days of manual typewriters. We think it is silly to lower a student’s grade for a missing space if typing skills are not what the teacher is trying to develop. We also will point out where there may be a difference in opinion. In these situations you should follow the guidelines your instructor provides; just know that you might have to do things differently in another course or for a different instructor. What format to use when citing sources is a very common point of different opinions. Finally, we will suggest free tools and resources that can help you avoid problems altogether. Going back to citing sources, academic literatures uses 8000+ different citation formats. Rather than learn the minute details of whether semi-colons should be italicized after the journal names (but not after book names) in a particular citation format, we will suggest using Zotero or some other citation manager to do that for you. In the end, we want you as a scientific writer to feel confident that you know WHAT your goals are, WHY those goals are important, and HOW to get there. Who knows? You may find that you have a hidden talent for it, on which you can build a career. Yet even if you never come to enjoy scientific writing, learning to do it well now will pay off regardless of where your professional path takes you.

Having an online book means we can make it freely available to all students and teachers. Being web-based also solves one of the main problems with any guide book like this: not everyone has the same rules and requirements for writing assignments. Instructors can copy this book, modify it to fit their requirements using free open-source software, then post the update back to their students. Who is the STEM Writing Project? We are a group of STEM teachers and education researchers who want to help other college teachers make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching. Scientific writing assignments are hard to manage in large introductory classes, and hard to evaluate systematically. This Writing Guide is just one of many tools we have available already, or are developing. Giving Credit Where Due Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Funding and Support This project was funded in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (ID# here.) "],["who-what-is-scientific-writing-for.html", "Who &amp; What is Scientific Writing For? Assumptions End Goals", " Who &amp; What is Scientific Writing For? The rest of this Guide details how to organize and create a lab report or other form of scientific communication. This kind of writing is very different from what most students have done in the past. Before we dive in, let’s look at the bigger picture and talk about the assumptions of scientific writing and the end goals that the writer hopes to accomplish. Assumptions Scientific writing starts with the assumption that its readers also are scientists (which includes scientists in training like you.) That means authors will assume their readers have certain background knowledge. If the readers do not have that, the author assumes the readers will look for that background on their own. Reading is the step to mastering scientific writing. End Goals Details differ, but The author starts with a question. It can be their own question The writer makes one or more claims related to that question, then provides evidence to support the claim(s). The evidence can be a logically reasoned argument, data collected in an experiment, something that someone else published in the past, or some other trustworthy source of information. The ultimate goal is to convince readers that the writer is asking an important (or at least interesting) question, and has found possible answer to the original question. "],["instructors-guide.html", "Instructors’ Guide Conventions Heresies", " Instructors’ Guide We created this Writing Guide as part of a larger set of resources for students and teachers working on scientific writing. The general format described conforms to the Council of Science Editors (8e) standards. This Writing Guide is not designed or intended to meet the needs of every possible audience. It is simply not feasible for a single source to be that comprehensive. released the entire text under Creative Commons license, so that for instructors to edit to fit their particular needs and requirements. Conventions Heresies When we first took a research-centered approach to lab report collection and assessment, one of our earliest discoveries was that some traditional writing conventions simply did not bear up to close scrutiny. We have aimed to reduce the number of arbitrary rules and requirements so that students can focus first on the key elements of writing as a means of communication and argumentation. Not all writing instructors will agree with our approach. We invite healthy debate and discussion, but the Global and structural flaws are more important for students to correct. Copy-editing and format are not important for novice writers to focus on. "],["science-writing-vocabulary.html", "Science Writing Vocabulary", " Science Writing Vocabulary There are many words and phrases with very specific meanings in STEM fields. Some of these terms are unique to STEM. For example, it would be very unusual to hear someone use the phrase “positive control” in daily conversation. In STEM (especially in biology), this phrase has a very specific meaning. Other terms have different meaning in general conversation vs. STEM fields. One of the big ones is “theory,” which in general conversation is used to describe an idea or educated guess for how something works. In STEM fields, theory is the name for a rigorously and repeatedly tested principle that describes how the world around us operates. Another example is the word “significant.” In general conversation this means something seems important. For scientists, it means the differences between two or more groups has been evaluated using one or more statistical tests, and the test indicates tha the two groups are probably not different just due to random chance. The word “significant” is so loaded for scientists that most will never use it in their writing EXCEPT when describing the results of statistical tests. These are some terms that can come up in the context of scientific writing, and how we define them.
