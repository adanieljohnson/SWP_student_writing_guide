"],["welcome.html", "Welcome! Why Create Another Writing Guide?", " Welcome! Many undergraduate biology courses require lab reports and other types of scientific writing. This genre is different from technical writing, which is the style we see in instruction manuals. It is the kind of writing that scientists do every day when they create articles for publication, write reports that summarize work they have done for their employer, when they apply for grant funding for their research, and even (less formally) when they write up observations in a lab notebook. Scientific writing is very closely connected with oral scientific presentations and posters, which we collectively call scientific communication. Formal scientific communication is very different from what most students have done in the past. This kind of communication is organized in a very specific way and follows particular rules and conventions. In this Guide we will focus on how to build a report that models a journal article. We’re doing that because most components of a lab report are used in other kinds of scientific communication too. For example, once you learn how to organize the Introduction to a lab report, you pretty much know how to organize the background section of an oral presentation. Making data figures is another example; the same figures used in a lab report could be used in a journal article, oral presentation, or poster. Why Create Another Writing Guide? There are plenty of books available already that explain how to organize and format scientific writing. This Guide goes beyond the “what is needed” and “how to do X” steps of writing, and explains some of the “why.” As teaching faculty in large introductory biology courses we watch many students go through the process of learning to communicate like scientists. A common frustration we hear over and over is “why do we have to do it this way? Why can’t I do it the way I learned before in (put any course you like here)?” We’ve found that, when we explain some of the logic or reasons behind elements of scientific writing, then the format and rules make sense and are easier to follow. We’ve also learned that sometimes overly strict rules actually get in the way of learning to write like a scientist. In this Guide we try to avoid repeating rules and requirements that are not central to learning to write well. For instance, some guides still insist that all sentences end with two spaces before the next sentence. This rule is left over from the days of manual typewriters. We think it is silly to lower a student’s grade for a missing space if typing skills are not what the teacher is trying to develop. We also will point out where there may be a difference in opinion. In these situations you should follow the guidelines your instructor provides; just know that you might have to do things differently in another course or for a different instructor. What format to use when citing sources is a very common point of different opinions. Finally, we will suggest free tools and resources that can help you avoid problems altogether. Going back to citing sources, academic literatures uses 8000+ different citation formats. Rather than learn the minute details of whether semi-colons should be italicized after the journal names (but not after book names) in a particular citation format, we will suggest using Zotero or some other citation manager to do that for you. In the end, we want you as a scientific writer to feel confident that you know WHAT your goals are, WHY those goals are important, and HOW to get there. Who knows? You may find that you have a hidden talent for it, on which you can build a career. Yet even if you never come to enjoy scientific writing, learning to do it well now will pay off regardless of where your professional path takes you.

We are a group of STEM teachers and education researchers who want to help other college teachers make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching. Scientific writing assignments are hard to manage in large introductory classes, and hard to evaluate systematically.

"],["who-what-is-scientific-writing-for.html", "Who &amp; What is Scientific Writing For? Scientific Writing Has a Specific Goal Scientific Writing Makes Assumptions About the Audience", " Who &amp; What is Scientific Writing For? The rest of this Guide details how to organize and create a lab report or other form of scientific communication. This kind of writing is very different from what most students have done in the past. Before we dive in, let’s look at the bigger picture and talk about what goal the writer hopes to accomplish (and how they get there), and the assumptions about the audience. Scientific Writing Has a Specific Goal The goal of scientific writing is to make an argument which convinces readers that the writer is asking an important (or at least interesting) question, and has found a possible answer to the original question. Usually the writer starts by introducing their question. It can be their own question, a problem that many scientists working in the field know about, or an observation that cannot be explained by the current understanding within the field. The writer provides some context for thinking about the question, usually by describing (and citing) what others have seen and said. Next, if the writer has conducted any new research studies, they will outline what methods and materials they used, providing enough detail for readers to judge whether or not their results can be considered reliable, and report what they observed. Writing that includes new studies is what we call primary literature. Writing that summarizes what others have written or done without doing new studies is what we call secondary literature, or review literature. In the next part, the writer makes one or more claims related to that question, then provides evidence to support the claim(s). The evidence can be data collected from a series of experiments, a logically reasoned argument, something that someone else published in the past, or some other trustworthy source of information. This step is when the writer actually tries to show they have found a possible answer to the original question. It also is when a good writer will outline the potential limitations of their own argument, and lay out new questions to think about. Scientific Writing Makes Assumptions About the Audience Scientific writing starts with the assumption that its readers are scientists working in the same or a closely related field. Each field has its own vocabulary, accepted styles and formats for sharing information. Authors assume their readers know the conventions of their field, including how and where important information is located in written work. Authors also assume their readers know certain general background concepts in their field. If the readers do not, they assume their readers will look for that background on their own. This is why so many students just starting out as science writers struggle at first: they don’t yet know this assumed knowledge. They are not alone; even long-time scientists can find it hard to switch to a new field. Fortunately, there is a way to learn the conventions and assumptions of any field, which is to read published work from that field. Instead of looking at what the scientific arguments or conclusions are though, look at how it is structured. How is information organized and presented? What is assumed prior knowledge? Look at multiple examples from the field: what vocabulary terms come up repeatedly? Answering these questions will uncover many of the assumptions that the author is making. "],["instructors-guide.html", "Instructors’ Guide Conventions Heresies", " Instructors’ Guide We created this Writing Guide as part of a larger set of resources for students and teachers working on scientific writing. The general format described conforms to the Council of Science Editors (8e) standards. This Writing Guide is not designed or intended to meet the needs of every possible audience. It is simply not feasible for a single source to be that comprehensive. released the entire text under Creative Commons license, so that for instructors to edit to fit their particular needs and requirements. Conventions Heresies When we first took a research-centered approach to lab report collection and assessment, one of our earliest discoveries was that some traditional writing conventions simply did not bear up to close scrutiny. We have aimed to reduce the number of arbitrary rules and requirements so that students can focus first on the key elements of writing as a means of communication and argumentation. Not all writing instructors will agree with our approach. We invite healthy debate and discussion, but the Global and structural flaws are more important for students to correct. Copy-editing and format are not important for novice writers to focus on. "],["science-writing-vocabulary.html", "Science Writing Vocabulary 0.1 Science Communication Relies On a Specialized Vocabulary 0.2 Vocabulary Is a Hurdle for New Scientific Writers 0.3 Vocabulary “Watch-Outs”", " Science Writing Vocabulary 0.1 Science Communication Relies On a Specialized Vocabulary Students learn a lot of new STEM vocabulary as part of regular class and lab work. Some words and phrases are unique to STEM, or used very rarely outside of STEM contexts. For example, it would be very unusual to hear someone use the phrase “positive control” in daily conversation, but in STEM fields (especially in biology), this phrase has a very specific meaning. Other terms have different meaning in general use vs. a STEM context. For instance the word “theory” is used in general conversation to describe a rough idea or educated guess for how something works. In STEM fields, theories are rigorously and repeatedly tested principles that describes how the world around us operates. In STEM, theories are just below laws (like the law of gravity) in terms of certainty. Another example is the word “significant.” In general conversation this means something seems important. For scientists, it means the differences between two or more groups has been evaluated using statistical tests, and the test indicates that the two groups are probably not different just due to random chance. The word “significant” is so loaded with assumed meaning that many scientists never use it EXCEPT when describing the results of statistical tests. 0.2 Vocabulary Is a Hurdle for New Scientific Writers In helping students learn to write, we regularly see them get hung up on specialized terms in one of three ways. They use the wrong word or phrase to describe a step they did in their experiment. An example would be using “positive control group” when they mean “the experimental treatment group.” They insert a specific word or phrase because it “sounds scientific,” not because it is the appropriate term. An example would be ——- They use a word or phrase, but the context is not right. An example would be ——- 0.3 Vocabulary “Watch-Outs” The terms defined below are called “watch-outs” because they have specific meanings, they come up regularly in scientific writing, and we often see students using them incorrectly. Your instructor may add other “watch-out” terms that they see misused regularly. Don’t avoid these terms, just take extra care to use them correctly. 0.3.1 Terms Describing Groups Within an Experiment Control (group): A control group is one used to determine what is normal for the study organism or system. We usually use this term as part of a comparison with the treatment group. In our experience the word “control” gives more students trouble than almost any other. Part of the problem is that we use the word “control” too loosely. There are different types of control groups, but we often do not say which one we are referring to. One way to avoid confusion is to never just say “control,” but rather say WHICH control group you mean. Negative control (group): A set of samples or replicates that you KNOW should not react or give a measurable result. They provide a baseline or background for the experiment. When the experiment is using an assay of some kind, the negative control usually is a sample that has all of the components needed except one for the reaction being measured. Positive control (group): A set of samples or replicates that you know WILL react or give a measurable result. Positive controls provide confirmation that the methods of analysis are working correctly. When the experiment is using an assay of some kind, the positive control usually is a sample that has all of the components needed for the reaction being measured, plus a sample that is known to have the substance being measured. Test, treatment, experimental (group): The group that received a treatment or experimental intervention. Replicates: Repeated versions of the same treatment, or repeated controls. When we perform experiments, we want to have some confidence that the results we observe are not due to random chance, and that the observations are due to the variable we wanted to test rather than some other factor. A well-designed experiment takes this into account by having replicates. Replicates get students into trouble because there are two kinds: experimental and technical. Experimental replicates are independent repeats of the experimental test. Technical replicates are not true replicates of the experimental group; they are repeated samples from one group. Let’s put this all together. Imagine we are running an enzyme assay with 12 tubes. All tubes get 4 mL of buffer and substrate. Tubes 1-3 get no enzyme added, Tubes 4-6 get 1 drop of unknown enzyme solution each, Tubes 7-9 get 3 drops of unknown enzyme solution each, and Tubes 10-12 get 3 drops of a known active enzyme solution each. In this example: Tubes 1-3 are the negative control group. There are 3 replicate tubes. Tubes 4-6 are the first experimental group. There are 3 replicates. Tubes 7-9 are the second experimental group, again with 3 replicates. Tubes 10-12 are the positive control group. We use a colorimeter to measure the amount of yellow product produced by enzyme activity after 10 minutes. We measure Tube 1, then 2, then 3. We then go back and measure each tube a SECOND time. Each tube was prepared separately, but following the same procedure, so we call Tubes 1-3 experimental replicates. When we measure the same replicate more than once, we call those measurements technical replicates. Technical replicates are used to make sure that we are measuring our samples accurately. The first and second measurements are not independent of each other, which is why we cannot call them experimental replicates. The three sample tubes are independent from one another, so we can call them experimental replicates. The difference between technical and experimental replicates will be important when we talk about how to report summary data and perform statistical analyses. 0.3.2 Terms Describing Types of Data Raw data: Summary or aggregate data: Transformed data: Going back to our enzyme assay in the previous section, 0.3.3 Terms Describing Types of Evidence Anecdotal vs. empirical evidence: Qualitative vs. quantitative evidence: "],["goals-of-scientific-writing.html", "Chapter 1 Goals of Scientific Writing", " Chapter 1 Goals of Scientific Writing Summarize how each feature of scientific writing contributes to the communication goals.

As we said earlier, most scientific writers assume their readers know the vocabulary and accepted styles and formats for sharing information in their field. The best way to learn the conventions and assumptions of any field is to read published work from that field. Instead of just looking at the scientific arguments or conclusions though, also pay attention to how the author has organized and presented the information. 4.1 Can We Trust the Authors? Scientists are skeptics who rarely accept something without evidence. One of the first questions you should ask as a skeptic-in-training is, “how do I know the author is trustworthy? Are they following accepted conventions of the field? How do I know they are not misleading me?” This is why we put so much emphasis on using peer-reviewed sources. “Peer review” means that the article you are reading was sent to two or more members of the scientific community who work in that particular field. They have read it, and told the author where to make corrections so the article meets the standards and expectations of their field. The editor of the journal may have given the author recommendations too. When the editor approves an article for publication, they are saying “other scientists in this field read this article and they agree with me that it meets our expectations and assumptions, and has something worthwhile to say.” That does not mean what the article says is always 100% correct. Mistakes do slip past the reviewers and editors, which is why you should always look at more than one article. "],["reading-scientific-literature-strategically.html", "Chapter 5 Reading Scientific Literature Strategically 5.1 Reading Strategically, Not Flat", " Chapter 5 Reading Scientific Literature Strategically Scientists write primary research articles to outline, summarize, and share the details of experimental studies. Review articles (sometimes called secondary literature) summarize primary literature and provide a broader overview of a topic or field. Review articles also can lay out the evidence on each side of a controversial field, or competing theories about how a process works. Ultimately some of this information is included in books like your textbook. Reading scientific articles efficiently is an important skill that develops with time and practice. You can develop this skill faster if you know how to approach articles systematically, and with a goal in mind. 5.1 Reading Strategically, Not Flat If you have not read many scientific articles, it is natural to try and read them “flat,” meaning from start to end, giving all of the content equal time and attention. This is how you might read a piece of fiction, a newspaper article, or maybe even a textbook. If you try to read primary research this way, it can take 1-3 hours to work through a 10-page article; even then you may not get much out of it. Most scientists DON’T read articles this way. Two readers may be looking at the same article for very different reasons. They read articles strategically, spending most (or all) of their reading effort pulling out the key information they need to meet the goals they had in mind when they started reading. One of the reasons that scientific articles are organized into specific sections (and why we stress format so much) is so readers within the field can find the information they need quickly. Here are some common goals that scientific readers might have. Each goal requires a slightly different approach to reading. A reader may have more than one goal, but rarely are they trying to achieve all of them at the same time. Someone new to a field or topic may want to: …so they will focus mostly on: Increase their basic background knowledge; the Introduction section. See examples of overall experimental designs related to their own questions; the Methods section in general. Learn how to do particular experimental assays or data analysis methods; descriptions of the assays and analyses, (or the cited sources that describe them); these tend to be towards the end of the Methods section. Find out which statistic methods are used to analyze a particular type of date; the Statistics section, which tends to be the last part of the Methods. See how particular types of results or data are summarized and displayed; the graphs, tables, and figures in the Results. Know what the rules are for the topic for claims, evidence, and reasoning; what is presented and focused on in the Discussion. Learn how data and evidence from studies by others has been interpreted (what the field accepts as reasonable); the interpretations in the Discussion. With practice, strategic reading goals become even more focused. For example: Someone with more experience may want to: …so they will focus mostly on: Get a deep understanding of a particular question that interests them; how the story told by the Introduction is organized, &amp; what prior knowledge is emphasized. Find out where other professionals are getting reagents or study organisms; the list of sources, or where the authors say they got materials. (Sometimes it is not in the article, so you must write the authors and ask them.) Identify &amp; understand controversies or unanswered questions; differences in the stories told in the Discussion section by authors from different labs. Put their own study into a larger context; the narrative in the Discussion. What do other authors say is important? Why? Compare their results to what others have reported; the data tables and figures, in particular how the trends they observed compare to published work by others. Find additional articles that could be useful for interpreting their own work; the full list of Literature Cited. What the influential labs, authors, and papers in the field are; which papers and authors are listed in the Literature Cited; which authors show up repeatedly. A way you can practice strategic reading is described on the next page. "],["practicing-strategic-reading.html", "Chapter 6 Practicing Strategic Reading", " Chapter 6 Practicing Strategic Reading This is a generic exercise that you can use to practice strategic reading. The basic steps are the same for many different reading goals. Your instructor may do this as a class exercise, but you can practice anytime on your own. Once you have the articles, the exercise should take less than 1 hour. It is short intentionally, so you are less likely to get bogged down or frustrated. PICK ONE READING GOAL that you want to practice. Start with one in the “new to the field” list. Focus on one reading area at a time. It does not help you to try and do it all at once. FIND FIVE PRIMARY ARTICLES that you will use to practice strategic reading. The first time your instructor may give you 5 articles and a specific goal to practice. If you must find your own articles, locate 1 article related to your goal. Then look at the in-text citations in the relevant section(s) for your goal. Get copies of 4 more cited articles that seem to be related. Do not worry about whether you have chosen good articles or not; judging their value is part of the exercise. Learning to find primary sources is an important skill on its own that we do not have time to teach you. To learn more about searching for literature, schedule a meeting with the local Science Reference Librarian. SKIM EACH OF THE FIVE ARTICLES you have chosen. Spend no more than 25 minutes on the 5 articles (5 minutes per article.) Identify and write down 3 pieces of concrete or specific information in EACH article that helps you meet the original stated goal. For now ignore interesting information that is not relevant to your main goal. If one of the articles you chose does NOT provide useful information related to your reading goal, rank it “less relevant,” and move on to the next article. PICK THE THREE MOST RELEVANT OR INFORMATIVE ARTICLES relative to your original reading goal. Spend no more than 5 minutes on this step. SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU LEARNED from the 3 most relevant or informative articles relative to your original reading goal. Spend no more than 20 minutes on this step. Summarize what you learned from these 3 articles. Do not just list the facts separately. Try to connect the information in the 3 articles together in one coherent argument or story. REVIEW WHAT YOU JUST DID. Where did you struggle or get bogged down? What took longer than it should have? If you had to do this same thing again, what would you change and why? Write down what you noticed so you can review it quickly the next time you have to read primary literature.

The more important a question or broad general statement is, the more evidence is needed to support it. This is why it is so hard to answer the question, “how many sources does my lab report need?” It depends on the story you are trying to tell, and the argument you are trying to make. Some arguments need more support than others. The best way to learn how to judge how many sources you need is to read published literature and look specifically at how citations are used. Foundational statements that are central to the whole story usually have multiple independent supporting sources (no referencing multiple articles by the same author or lab!). Observations by one particular lab or an unusual experimental method might have one citation. 12.2 How Strong is the Evidence? Some professional societies and government agencies like the National Cancer Institute publish summary statements that are meant to guide public or health policy. These statements are based on literature in the field, but the authors do more than just list the sources of their information. They include a “Level of Evidence” rating that is determined by an expert panel of reviewers. Say the NCI published a statement saying “walking every day reduces your risk of dying due to four specific cancers [2,3,18; LoE= solid].” This is the highest Level of Evidence that NCI uses. It means the statement is based on data obtained from several well-designed and well-conducted randomized clinical trials within the general population, and the studies report evidence about both benefits and harms. Studies with other levels of supporting research will get a different rating, like “good,” “fair,” “weak,” or even “inadequate.” Other agencies and societies will have their As a writer-in-training you will not need to rate the level or quality of the evidence you cite. However, it IS important to understand that, just because something is published, it does not make it universally true. The more important the question (does walking reduce cancer risk?) the more data we need to make a broad general statement. s, however, not always practical to conduct such trials to address every question within the field of screening and prevention. Thus, the PDQ Editorial Board does consider “fair” evidence in estimating the benefits and harms of an intervention in the general population. When the evidence for the benefits and/or harms of an intervention is “inadequate,” the Board states this finding. Levels of Evidence Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
