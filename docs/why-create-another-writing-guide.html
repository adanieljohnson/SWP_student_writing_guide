<h1>Why Create Another Writing Guide?</h1>
<p>Many undergraduate biology courses require lab reports and other types of <strong>scientific writing.</strong> This genre is different from technical writing, which is the style we see in instruction manuals. It is the kind of writing that scientists do every day whwn they create articles for publication, write reports that summarize work they have done for their employer, when they apply for grant funding for their research, and even (less formally) when they write up observations in a lab notebook. Scientific writing is very closely connected with oral scientific presentations and posters, which we collectively call <strong>scientific communication</strong>.</p>
<p>Formal scientific communication is organized in a very specific way and follows particular rules and conventions. In this Guide we will focus on how to build a report that models a journal article. We’re doing that because the components of a lab report can be used in most other kinds of scientific communication. For example, once you learn how to organize the Introduction to a lab report, you pretty much know how to organize the background section of an oral presentation. Making data figures is another example; the same figures used in a lab report could be used in a journal article, oral presentation, or poster.</p>
<p>This Guide goes beyond the “what is needed” and “how to do X” steps of writing, and explains some of the “why.” As teaching faculty in large introductory biology courses we watch many students go through the process of learning to communicate like scientists. A common frustration we hear over and over is “why do we have to do it this way? Why can’t I do it the way I learned before in (put any course you like here)?” We’ve found that, when we explain some of the logic or reasons behind elements of scientific writing, then the format and rules make sense and are easier to follow.</p>
<p>We’ve also learned that sometimes overly strict rules actually get in the way of learning to write like a scientist. In this Guide we try to avoid repeating rules and requirements that are not central to learning to write well. For instance, some guides still insist that all sentences end with two spaces before the next sentence. This rule is left over from the days of manual typewriters. We think it is silly to lower a student’s grade for a missing space if typing skills are not what the teacher is trying to develop.</p>
<p>We also will point out where there may be a difference in opinion. In these situations you should follow the guidelines your instructor provides; just know that you might have to do things differently in another course or for a different instructor. What format to use when citing sources is a very common point of different opinions.</p>
<p>Finally, we will suggest free tools and resources that can help you avoid problems altogether. Going back to citing sources, academic literatures uses 8000+ different citation formats. Rather than learn the minute details of whether semi-colons should be italicized after the journal names (but not after book names) in a particular citation format, we will suggest using Zotero or some other citation manager to do that for you.</p>
<p>In the end, we want you as a scientific writer to feel confident that you know WHAT your goals are, WHY those goals are important, and HOW to get there. Who knows? You may find that you have a hidden talent for it, on which you can build a career. Yet even if you never come to enjoy scientific writing, learning to do it well now will pay off regardless of where your professional path takes you.</p>

<p>First let’s talk about the <strong>fundamental goals</strong> that the writer hopes to accomplish.</p>
<p>Scientific writing starts with the assumption that the readers also are scientists (which includes scientists in training like you.) That means authors will assume their readers have certain background knowledge, and if the readers do not, then the readers will look for that background on their own.</p>
<p>Details differ, but The author starts with a question. It can be their own question</p>
<p>The writer makes one or more claims related to that question, then provides evidence to support the claim(s). The evidence can be a logically reasoned argument, data collected in an experiment, something that someone else published in the past, or some other trustworthy source of information. The ultimate goal is to convince readers that the writer is asking an important (or at least interesting) question, and has found possible answer to the original question.</p>
<p>This kind of writing is very different from what most students have done in the past.</p>
<p>It
There are plenty of books available that tell students how to organize and format these</p>
