# Practicing Strategic Reading
This is a generic exercise that you can use to practice strategic reading. The basic steps are the same for many different reading goals. Your instructor may do this as a class exercise, but you can practice anytime on your own.

Once you have the articles, the exercise should take less than 1 hour. It is short intentionally, so you are less likely to get bogged down or frustrated.

1. PICK ONE READING GOAL that you want to practice. Start with one in the "new to the field" list. Focus on one reading area at a time. It does not help you to try and do it all at once.
2. FIND FIVE PRIMARY ARTICLES that you will use to practice strategic reading. The first time your instructor may give you 5 articles and a specific goal to practice. 
    + If you must find your own articles, locate 1 article related to your goal. Then look at the in-text citations in the relevant section(s) for your goal. Get copies of 4 more cited articles that seem to be related. 
    + Do not worry about whether you have chosen good articles or not; judging their value is part of the exercise. Learning to find primary sources is an important skill on its own that we do not have time to teach you. 
    + To learn more about searching for literature, schedule a meeting with the local Science Reference Librarian.
3. SKIM EACH OF THE FIVE ARTICLES you have chosen. Spend no more than 25 minutes on the 5 articles (5 minutes per article.) Identify and write down 3 pieces of concrete or specific information in EACH article that helps you meet the original stated goal. 
    + For now ignore interesting information that is not relevant to your main goal. 
    + If one of the articles you chose does NOT provide useful information related to your reading goal, rank it "less relevant," and move on to the next article.
4. PICK THE THREE MOST RELEVANT OR INFORMATIVE ARTICLES relative to your original reading goal. Spend no more than 5 minutes on this step.
5. SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU LEARNED from the 3 most relevant or informative articles relative to your original reading goal. Spend no more than 20 minutes on this step. Summarize what you learned from these 3 articles.
    + Do not just list the facts separately. Try to connect the information in the 3 articles together in one coherent argument or story.
6. REVIEW WHAT YOU JUST DID. Where did you struggle or get bogged down? What took longer than it should have? If you had to do this same thing again, what would you change and why? Write down what you noticed so you can review it quickly the next time you have to read primary literature.
