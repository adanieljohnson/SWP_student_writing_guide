# Photographs, Diagrams and Illustrations

Photos and diagrams (drawings, maps, or other visual data) summarize data that are not described easily in words or cannot be presented in a graph. A map of the 2–dimensional distribution of organisms in a test site, or photos of the pattern of blue staining in control and cold–treated transgenic plants, are two examples. An illustration summarizing the workflow of the experiment would be another example. 

Like all figures, photos and diagrams should have a figure number and caption describing what is shown.

When using photos and diagrams, do not include every photo or diagram you have. Select just a few that will show the reader of the outcome of your experiment. Crop photos so the important visual information fills the frame. Photos and diagrams should have a figure number and caption describing what is shown. 

Look at these two examples. Which is more informative, and visually better organized?
