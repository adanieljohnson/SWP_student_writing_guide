#Instructors' Guide

We created this Writing Guide as part of a larger set of resources for students and teachers working on scientific writing. 

The general format described conforms to the Council of Science Editors (8e) standards. 

This Writing Guide is not designed or intended to meet the needs of every possible audience. It is simply not feasible for a single source to be that comprehensive.

## Conventions


## Heresies
When we first took a research-centered approach to lab report collection and assessment, one of our earliest discoveries was that some traditional writing conventions simply did not bear up to close scrutiny. 

We have aimed to reduce the number of arbitrary rules and requirements so that students can focus first on the key elements of writing as a means of communication and argumentation. 

Not all writing instructors will agree with our approach. We invite healthy debate and discussion, but the 

Global and structural flaws are more important for students to correct. Copy-editing and format are not important for novice writers to focus on.
