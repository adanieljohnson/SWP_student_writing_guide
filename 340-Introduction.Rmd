# Introduction

The introduction tells the reader what topic you are addressing, presents the current state of knowledge of this topic, and ties prior knowledge and background information to your biological question. 

The written version begins with a brief general introduction to the subject or problem, then moves on to more specific information that relates to your hypothesis. It will explain the underlying biological principles a reader needs to know to understand the purpose of the experiment. 

These are the questions your should try to answer in the Introduction.

1. What do we already know about this particular organism, biochemical system, or experimental model? 
2. What questions come to mind when we think about this system? In other words, what is the biological question we might ask, or current unknowns we might explore? (Getting more specific.)
3. What question are __you__ focusing on? Why are you asking this question? What do we need to know to answer it? (Still more specific.)
4. What model system are you using? Why?
5. What do you expect to happen in this model system? Why are you predicting this will happen? (This last item is your hypothesis. Be sure you state it clearly, and that it is a __testable__ hypothesis.) 


## Other Important Features, Tips

The Introduction should make it clear what your dependent and independent variables are. You can either say this as part of the hypothesis or explain it as part of the overall purpose of the experiment.

The Introduction should always include the scientific name of any study organisms (in _italics_, with first letter of the genus capitalized and the rest of the name in lower case). If you are not using an intact organism, always say what model system you are using. Include a brief (1-2 sentences) explanation for why the model organism or system is a good choice for your experiment.

Sources for all information that is not common knowledge need to be referenced using the (Name, Year) citation format [\(described further here\)](http:url). Use primary literature whenever possible, and avoid secondary literature unless that is the only source you can find; do not use non-scientific literature at all. If you are unsure whether or not a source is an appropriate one, ask your instructor.

Often we see students try to find supporting sources that describe their exact same experiment. __Don’t try to find an experiment just like yours__. You do not need a source to prove you “did the experiment right.” The goal of doing and reporting experiments is to widen our knowledge of the world around us. We use what others have published as a starting point for asking new questions. There is a very practical reason not to do this too. If you sent a paper out for review that is nearly identical to another scientist’s work, the editor of the journal will immediately return it with a rejection letter saying that you have not made any significant contribution to that particular field. 


## Examples of Poorly Written Introduction Sections

### No General Perspective

1. What do we already know about this particular organism, biochemical system, or experimental model? 
2. What questions come to mind when we think about this system? In other words, what is the biological question we might ask, or current unknowns we might explore? (Getting more specific.)
4. What model system are you using? Why?


### Poor Flow

3. What question are __you__ focusing on? Why are you asking this question? What do we need to know to answer it? (Still more specific.)


### No Clear Hypothesis

5. What do you expect to happen in this model system? Why are you predicting this will happen? (This last item is your hypothesis. Be sure you state it clearly, and that it is a __testable__ hypothesis.)
