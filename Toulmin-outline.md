The Toulmin Model of Argumentation 

Definition of an argument.


Anatomy of an Argument

We make casual arguments in conversations all of the time. In these situations some parts of an argument may be implied or assumed. When a scientific writer makes an argument, we cannot make these same assumptions; we have to make our arguments sound, clear, and precise. We do that by paying attention to details. A weak argument may be missing some essential parts or the connections between the parts may be flawed.

Who Toulmin is


Toulmin wrote that most “practical arguments” could be broken down into these specific parts. 

1.	Claim, Conclusion, Recommendation, or Action: 
The position or thing being argued for; the conclusion of the argument; the recommended or planned course of action.
2.	Evidence / Grounds: 
Reasons or supporting evidence that bolster the claim. In science, this would be directly observable evidence, provided by the person making the argument. 
3.	Reasoning / Warrant: 
Principle, provision or chain of reasoning that connects the grounds/evidence to the claim. 
4.	Backing: 
External evidence, support, justification, or rationale that backs up the reasoning. The main difference between evidence and backing is that evidence supports the claim, and backing is used to support the reasoning statements themselves.
5.	Rebuttal/Reservation: 
Exceptions to the claim; counter-examples and counter-arguments. 
6.	Qualification: 
Limits on claim, evidence, or reasoning. Essentially, when the argument is NOT valid anymore.

Many disciplines use slightly different versions of the Toulmin model. It is a useful tool for thinking through and evaluating arguments systematically. Do not get hung up on the terms; focus on the parts of a good argument, and how you can use them when writing.


Building a Basic Argument
1.	All arguments will state a claim (which also can be called a recommendation, conclusion or action.) The simplest arguments are just a claim statement. The person making the claim assumes their listener(s) will fill in the rest. We make these kinds of statements all the time in conversation. For instance:

“Dogs like to chase squirrels more than cats.”

This simple claim would be fine in a casual conversation, but it needs more if we need to convince someone else we are right. 

2.	Usually a claim will have supporting evidence. There are two kinds of evidence in practical arguments. We can present direct evidence (Toulmin called it ‘grounds’) that supports the claim itself. 

“Dogs like to chase squirrels more than cats. I mean, my dog has always chased squirrels and left our cat alone.”

The speaker is making a simple conversational claim that dogs like to chase squirrels more than cats based entirely on a personal observation as direct evidence. This is not great evidence, but at least now we know the evidence on which their claim is based.

3.	Reasoning (which Toulmin called ‘warrant’) is the logical connection between the claim and the evidence. We also can evidence that backs up and supports our reasoning (what Toulmin called ‘backing.’) Look at this argument statement:

“We concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, because the data in Table 1 show…”

The claim is “dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats,” and now it is based on direct evidence (the data in Table 1.) The explanation of the data in Table 1, and how it supports the claim, would be the reasoning part of this argument. 

This is where new scientific writers’ arguments are MOST likely to break down:
•	They do not interpret the collected data correctly or carefully; 
•	They do not explain the logic connecting the evidence and the claim; or
•	They use flawed logic or reasoning to connect the claim and evidence.

Compare the reasoning in these statements. Which argument is better, and why? (Assume all three are referring to the same table of data.)

A.	“We concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, because the data in Table 1 show dogs almost never chased cats, and always chased squirrels.”

B.	“We concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, because the data in Table 1 show dogs given a choice to chase a cat or a squirrel chose to chase the cat 27% of the time but chased squirrels 59% of the time (slightly more than 2-fold more often). In the remaining trials, 5% of dogs attempted to chase both animals, switching from one to the other at least once in the first 5 seconds. Nine percent of dogs chased neither the cat nor the squirrel but begged the handler for attention instead.”

C.	“We concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, because the data in Table 1 show all dogs hate squirrels, but some dogs tolerate cats.”


 
Extending a Basic Argument
More complex arguments have additional elements that depend on a solid “claim-evidence-reasoning” chain. They cannot stand on their own without it. 

4.	Weight, variety, or quality of the evidence. Say we made a sound argument that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats based on our own experimental data. Has anyone else shown similar results? 

In the sciences, NO concept or idea can be proved conclusively. ALL knowledge is provisional, meaning open to being disproven. As a result, scientists place greater confidence on concepts supported by multiple independent lines of evidence. 

There are no hard rules for judging the weight, variety, and quality of evidence. Every discipline has its own expectations and standards. In general though:
•	One study is just that: one study. There is a greater weight of evidence if other studies have used the same method as we did and saw the same outcome. 
•	If we did our study using one breed of dog, but five other groups did the same study a different way using five other breeds of dogs, we now have a wider variety of evidence. 
•	Quality is the hardest of all to judge:
o	Anecdotal evidence (“someone told me a friend of theirs saw…”) is weak, low-quality evidence. Well-designed and -controlled experiments tend to produce higher quality evidence.
o	Two independent studies done by different teams under different conditions that show the same outcomes tends to be higher quality evidence than multiple studies that are all done by one team. 
o	Imagine we and the other five teams all found potential alternative explanations for our results that we did not control for in our studies. A seventh team does a new study using 100 dogs from 9 breeds plus mixed breeds, and they use a completely different method for testing dogs than all of the rest of us used. They also rigorously eliminate every alternative that the other teams thought up. Their study shows exactly the same outcome: 93% of the dogs they tested chased squirrels more often than cats. We can probably safely say that there is high-quality evidence to support the claim. 
•	Statistical tests strengthen evidence but having a statistically significant difference (p value <0.05) between two study groups does not automatically mean the difference is real or even important. 
o	Statistical analyses need to be interpreted just as carefully as the summarized data.

5.	Exceptions, qualifications, counter-evidence, rebuttal arguments, or other limits to the claim, evidence, or reasoning. 

No claim is universally true. There are always times or situations where it does not apply or needs amendment. One way arguments can be taken apart and disproved is by looking for these exceptions. A savvy writer will anticipate questions and potential opposition to their claims by making and rebutting the counter-argument BEFORE anyone else raises it. Going back to our example: 

“While we concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, this may not be true in urban areas where dogs rarely encounter squirrels but see cats more frequently. While we have no evidence to support it as yet, we also expect that dogs living in areas with a larger raccoon than squirrel population will be more likely to chase cats, because cats and raccoons have similar foraging times and behaviors (see Rocker, 2021 for details.) Seeing raccoons more often will prime dogs to chase larger animals running on the ground rather than climbing trees…”

6.	Implications of the claim, recommendation, or action. This is the “so what” part of the argument. What are the possible events or effects that could occur if the argument made is true? Continuing the example from #5:

“While we concluded that dogs are more likely to chase squirrels than cats, this may not be true in urban areas where dogs rarely encounter squirrels but see cats more frequently…and seeing raccoons more often will prime dogs to chase larger animals running on the ground rather than climbing trees. 

This conclusion suggests that emergency veterinarians serving areas with large tree squirrel populations should expect more dogs to present with skeletal injuries associated with vertical leaping and falling. Those serving urban areas and areas with high feral raccoon numbers should expect more “fight and bite” injuries to the face and head, and so more clients needing suturing. Clinic spaces should be adjusted accordingly.”
