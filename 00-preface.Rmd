# (PART) Preface {-}
# Why Create Another Writing Guide? {-}
This book began as a monthly work calendar and article series that I wrote for our local bonsai club newsletter. The articles answered questions from club members, addressed various growing and styling challenges that came up in club meetings, or sprang out of simple curiosity. Over time the collection of articles grew into a good-sized body of knowledge about growing and maintaining bonsai in our area. 
This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
