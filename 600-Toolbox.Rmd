# (PART) Your Writer's Toolbox {-}
# What's In Your Toolbox? {#toolbox600}

Up to now we've focused mostly on the "what goes where" mechanics of scientific writing. In this Section we're going to step back from the nuts and bolts of writing and show you how to build sound arguments, then assess your own and others' writing, thinking, and logic more critically. Think of this Section as adding to and refining the basic set of tools that you put together so far. 

What you will learn:

* How to approach the task of writing more strategically
* How to structure a good argument, and evaluate the arguments of others
* How to use peer review to improve your own writing, and help other students improve theirs.
