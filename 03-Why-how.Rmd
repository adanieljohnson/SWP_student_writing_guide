## Why An Open Online Book? {-}
Having an online book means we can make it freely available to all students and teachers. Being web-based also solves one of the main problems with any guide book like this: not everyone has the same rules and requirements for writing assignments. Instructors can copy this book, modify it to fit their requirements using free open-source software, then post the update back to their students.  

## What is the STEM Writing Project? {-}
Who is probably the better question. We are a group of STEM teachers and education researchers who want to help other college teachers make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching. Scientific writing assignments are hard to manage in large introductory classes, and hard to evaluate systematically. This Writing Guide is just one of many tools we have available already, or are developing.
