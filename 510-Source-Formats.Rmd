# Citing Your Sources

Life sciences journals follow the CSE (Council of Science Editors) style guide for print and web publication. Unlike other formats you might have used in humanities or social science classes, there is not a single standard "CSE style." Instead CSE recommends what information citations should contain, then leaves the details of styling up to each journal or publisher. That means if you randomly select primary articles from 10 different life science journals, you will see 10 slightly to very different citation formats. 

__There is no one "right" citation format__. Each format has benefits and drawbacks. We think it is more important to focus on using citations well than to focus on whether commas are in the right place. Still, it is useful if you know a little about different formats so you know how to find the information you need when reading articles.


## Types of In-Text Citations

The two main formats for in-text citations are the name-year format, and various numbered citations formats. Using footnotes for citing sources is rarely used in the sciences.


### Name-Year Format

This style of in-text citations uses the last names of the first 1-3 authors of a source and the year of publication to cite the source. Here is an example of the name-year format in action, using the paragraph from the top of this page:

> Life sciences journals follow the CSE (Council of Science Editors) style guide for print and web publication (CSE, 2017). Unlike other formats you might have used in humanities or social science classes (Johnson, 2018), there is not a single standard "CSE style." Instead CSE recommends what information citations should contain, then leaves the details of styling up to each journal or publisher (Taylor & Coleridge, 2019). That means if you randomly select primary articles from 10 different life science journals, you will see 10 slightly to very different citation formats (Johnson, 2018; Albert, et al. 2010). 

Different journals use slightly different versions of this basic in-text citation format. Some include first name initials (Johnson A.D., 2018), have or do not have commas or periods, etc. The benefit of this format is that readers can tell when evidence you cite was published, and who published it. The trade-off is each citation takes up more space in the text. Some people find it interferes with reading flow too. 


### Numbered List Formats

For this in-text citation style, every source listed in the Literature Cited is assigned a number that is used to identify that reference in the main text. Numbers can be in parentheses (3,4,6-9), in brackets [2,5,7-8], or as superscripts<sup>1,4,7,11</sup>. 

When using a numbered list, the sources can be numbered in order of their first appearance in the text. For example:

> Life sciences journals follow the CSE (Council of Science Editors) style guide for print and web publication (1). Unlike other formats you might have used in humanities or social science classes (2), there is not a single standard "CSE style." Instead CSE recommends what information citations should contain, then leaves the details of styling up to each journal or publisher (3). That means if you randomly select primary articles from 10 different life science journals, you will see 10 slightly to very different citation formats (2, 4). 

For the above example, sources would be listed in the Literature Cited section in this order. 

1. CSE, 2017
2. Johnson, 2018
3. Taylor & Coleridge, 2019
4. Albert, et al. 2010

Alternatively, the sources can be numbered in alphabetical order using the last name of the first author. For example:

> Life sciences journals follow the CSE (Council of Science Editors) style guide for print and web publication (2). Unlike other formats you might have used in humanities or social science classes (3), there is not a single standard "CSE style." Instead CSE recommends what information citations should contain, then leaves the details of styling up to each journal or publisher (4). That means if you randomly select primary articles from 10 different life science journals, you will see 10 slightly to very different citation formats (1,3). 

For this example, the sources would be listed in the Literature Cited section in this order. 

1. Albert, et al. 2010
2. CSE, 2017
3. Johnson, 2018
4. Taylor & Coleridge, 2019


In-text numbers are more compact and less distracting, but they do not tell readers anything about who published the source or when. Sources also must be re-numbered every time a source is added or removed or the order of sources changes. 


## What Do WE Recommend?

In our introductory courses we use the standard, plain-vanilla __APA name-year citation format__. It is well documented and most reference managers (including Zotero) support it. Citations can be downloaded in APA-compatible format directly from PubMed, Web of Science, and most other databases. If a database does not offer APA style as an export option, they usually offer the Harvard citation format, which is almost the same. Alternatively citations can be downloaded in RIS format, imported into Zotero, and converted to APA format.

__We do NOT follow the full APA Style Guide, only the citations formats.__ For example, APA style allows direct quotes in text; we do not allow our students to quote sources. In the past, we found students often cited quotes incorrectly. Even if they cited the sources correctly, students quoted so much from sources that almost none of what they wrote was their own words. When we eliminated quotes entirely, our students started to learn to paraphrase and use sources sooner, and could do it more accurately.


### Formats For In-Text Citations

APA allows both parenthetical or narrative versions of the name-year in-text format. Parenthetical citations are more common. For example, this is a parenthetical citation for a source with one author:

> Learning theories (Brown, 2014) point to practical ways to improve rats' ability to solve the maze puzzle without requiring more training time.

If the source has two authors, then the parenthetical reference must list them both:

> Sequenced-based analysis of nucleotide usage found patterns similar to what has been reported previously (Gottschalk & Hjortshoj, 2004).

If the source has three or more authors, the last name of the first author is used with "et al.", which is the Latin abbreviation for "and others":

> Sampling methods in ecology have had a longstanding problem with bringing together theories and practical challenges (Albert et al., 2010).

Narrative citations use the name(s) of the source author(s) in the sentence, and put the year in parentheses. For example:

> Alberts, et al. (2010) found that sampling methods in ecology have a longstanding problem with bringing together theories and practical challenges.

In practice we try to discourage our students from using narrative citations, at least when they first start out in scientific writing. They can be a challenge to do well, and are slightly harder to keep properly formatted.


### Formats For The Literature Cited Section

The APA formats for the most common types of sources used in lab reports our outlined below. The [complete guide to APA Citation Formats](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples)  is available online. Look there for other citation formats, but remember APA supports many source types that are not appropriate for lab reports.

### Using and Citing Electronic Materials

We see students make a LOT of mistakes when using electronic sources. That is why we do not let students in our program use them as their main sources of information. If you plan to use electronic materials as part of your cited sources, you need to be very careful to cite them correctly.

The most common mistake we see is students using a URL or web address for an article as a citation. __This is not acceptable in scientific writing.__ A valid citation for an electronic source still has the names of the authors, name of the resource, and when and where it was accessed. Never use just the URL from a Pubmed, Web of Science, or Google Scholar page, or a DOI link on its own to identify or cite a source. 

The other common mistake we see students make is using unreliable web sources. General access web pages are not acceptable sources because the content is not peer reviewed for accuracy by subject matter experts. Wikipedia should not be used as a sources for that reason. Electronic sources need to be peer reviewed, and preferably primary sources.  

In general, you can safely use electronic materials obtained from official publications of government agencies (site URLs usually end with “.gov”). Web sites of scholarly research projects associated with a research institution or university are acceptable sources, but should never be the sole source of information. 

Some web pages have content that changes over time and is not archived. If this is true for the site you are referencing, include the date you retrieved the information in the reference.

## Advanced Topic: What Exactly IS a DOI?

As more material became available online in the 2000s, publishers adopted a new way to track materials called __digital object identifiers__ (DOIs). Often DOIs are embedded as web links, but even when a DOI is not an active link, you can find the original source by copying the DOI and using it as a search term in Google. 

Started by the major journal publishers, DOIs have grown into nearly universally recognized identifiers. What makes them so useful is that they are catalogued in one central electronic database. If the location where a particular source is stored changes, the publisher is required to update the link to it in the central database. As a result, researchers know where to access a DOI-tagged source regardless of which publisher originally produced it. 

Currently the Council of Science Editors does __not__ recommend using DOIs as the sole form of citation, for two reasons. First, DOIs do not tell the reader anything about the authors or source of the information, only where it is located online. Second, DOIs are not useful when a reader does not have access to a web browser. That is why APA and other citation formats include the DOI at the end of a citation, but do not use it in place of the traditional information (authors, year, etc.)
