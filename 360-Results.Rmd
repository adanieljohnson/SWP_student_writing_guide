# Results

The Results section is where you report your observations and findings. You also  summarize and organize your findings (especially numbers) so they are easier to understand. 

These are the questions your should try to answer in the Results.

1. Where are your data summarized? What tables and figures?
2. What general trends did you see? Did specific trials or runs within the larger experiment come out differently? If so, how were they different?
3. If you tested more than one group (or had test and control groups) are they statistically different from one another? How much?


## Other Tips

Do not repeat details you already provided in the Materials and Methods. 

NEVER include raw data. Only report the summarized data.

Do not try to interpret or discuss your data just yet. Be careful to refrain from any kind of interpretation of the data in this section. Only state what your results __were__, not what they might __mean__.
