## Writing Figure Legends

The figure legend for each graph should include a Figure #. The figures should be numbered in the order they are first referred to in the text. The first sentence should explain what the graph is showing generally. The legend also should describe any summary statistics that are included in the graph. 

Beyond these guidelines, figure legends vary in how much information they contain. Generally though, the figures with their legends should summarize most or all of the experiment. Readers should not have to look back at the text to understand the figures.  


## Tips For Creating More Effective Graphs

These tips address the most frequent mistakes we see in our students' graphs. 

* Be sure your graphs are legible. Do not try to put too much data in a single figure. Clutter keeps readers from extracting information effectively. 
* Use fonts and font sizes that are easy to read. 
* Do not skimp on space. Small figures are hard to read. A rule of thumb is to draw your graphs so they fill at least half of a standard print page. 
* Use clearly different textures or plot elements to indicate different sets of data (for example, the black vs. white bars in the bar graph shown in Figure 1 above, and the different shaped symbols in Figure 2B).
* When you plot means in a bar or line graph, always include error bars that show the standard error of the means. 
    + Don't let Excel decide what the error bar values should be; its default choice is not correct for scientific articles. Put in the standard error bar values yourself.
    + Usually you will use +/- 1 s.d. for your error bars.
    + Be sure to say in the figure legend what the error bars represent.  
* Be sure to label the x-axis (independent values) and y-axis (dependent values) properly. 
* Don't put a title above the graph. Your figure legend does that job.
* Check, recheck, and check again that the figures are numbered in the same order that you refer to them in your report.
