# Reporting Your Data

Part 4 of this Guide shows you how to summarize, analyze, then present data that you collect during your experiments. This page provides a general overview; other pages provide more specific instructions, and links to additional resources.

We describe summarizing and analyzing your data as separate steps in the writing process. In practice though, you probably will be working on both at the same time. 

## How Should You Report Your Results?

Results of an experiment can be summarized and reported several ways. Which method you should use depends on what kind of data you are trying to share with readers, and what you want readers to understand or see.

Generally we lump photos, diagrams, and illustrations with data graphs, charts, and other visual data summaries under the umbrella name of __figures__. Usually you present your results in the form of a table or a figure, but not both. The only time it is appropriate to present the same data twice in different forms is when the data need to be interpreted more than one way. This is not something you usually need to do in student lab reports though.

Imagine you did an experiment to determine the minimum and maximum amount of 6 different Bâ€“vitamins that fence lizards must consume each day to maintain healthy scale shape and color. What kinds of data would you collect, and how might you report the results in an article?  

It is unlikely that your readers know what fence lizard scales look like close up, let alone the normal color and shape of the scales. In this situation you could use __photographs__ to report visual observations that are not easily quantified, or when it is useful for readers to see for themselves what you observed. You might choose two photos; one showing healthy scales and another showing deformed, poorly colored scales. Now your readers have some context for the other data you will present. [How to use photos and illustrations effectively is explained further here.](http:url.430)

You observe that the color of the scales is normal as long as the __ratio__ of B1 to B6 in the lizards' diet is 1:10. Lizards with a diet containing 10 mg B1 and 100 mg B6 have normally shaped gray scales. Lizards eating a diet that is deficient in both vitamins (say, averaging 1 mg B1 and 10 mg B6) develop deformed scales but the scales are still gray. If their diet changes so it has 10 mg B1 and 10 mg B6, the lizards' scales turn tan or brown. For this observation, the relative levels of vitamins are more important for the reader to see. When your readers need to see ratios, trends or changes over time, a __data graph or chart__ usually is the best way to summarize and report your results. [How to create data graphs and charts is explained here.](http:url.425)

Suppose you observe instead that the relative amounts of B1 compared to B6 is not that important; it is the absolute quantity (i.e., 10 mg B1, and 100 mg B6) of each vitamin that determines whether the scales have the correct shape and color. Now your readers need to know the specific numbers, so a __data summary table__ would be the better choice to report your results. [How to put together data tables is explained here.](http:url.435)


## How to Embed Figures and Tables In Your Reports

Tables and figures are numbered separately, in the order they are referred to in your text. You MUST reference each table and figure in the text of your lab report. If you do not reference each table or figure, readers do not know where to look for the data you are using to support your claims. 

Usually table legends, tables, figure legends, and figured are placed in that order at the end of a lab report, after the Literature Cited, starting on a new page. Some instructors want you to put each figure or table and its legend in the main text, right after you refer to it. If you are unsure which format to use, ask your instructor. If you must make the choice yourself, put all of the tables and figures at the end of your report. 

You might wonder why tables and figures are put at the end rather than being inserted into the text. It is a holdover from the time before online electronic submission. Prior to the mid-1990s, authors had to send 3-5 hard copies of their manuscript to a journal editor for review. Tables and figures were placed at the back so the reviewers could look at all of them at one time while they read the text. If the manuscript was accepted for publication the tables, figures, and text were split up and sent to different departments. The main text was sent to a typesetter, tables to a table layout artist, and figures to a photographer who converted them into print-ready images. The printers then reassembled the different parts later. 

Even though manuscripts are submitted electronically today, the pieces still need to be processed separately. To make this easier, journals require authors to submit their manuscripts with figures and tables separated from the text.

[HHMI Data Explorer](https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/data-explorer) is an interactive web site that you can use to build graphs and learn how different parts go together. In the __Materials__ box on the right side are links for two useful guides you can download that summarize 1) different types of graphs, and 2) different statistical tests.
