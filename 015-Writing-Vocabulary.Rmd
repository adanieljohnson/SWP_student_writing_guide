# Science Writing Vocabulary {-}
## Science Communication Relies On a Specialized Vocabulary
Students learn a lot of new STEM vocabulary as part of regular class and lab work. Some words and phrases are unique to STEM, or used very rarely outside of STEM contexts. For example, it would be very unusual to hear someone use the phrase "positive control" in daily conversation, but in STEM fields (especially in biology), this phrase has a very specific meaning. 

Other terms have different meaning in general use vs. a STEM context. For instance the word "theory" is used in general conversation to describe a rough idea or educated guess for how something works. In STEM fields, theories are rigorously and repeatedly tested principles that describes how the world around us operates. In STEM, theories are just below laws (like the law of gravity) in terms of certainty. 

Another example is the word "significant." In general conversation this means something seems important. For scientists, it means the differences between two or more groups has been evaluated using statistical tests, and the test indicates that the two groups are probably not different just due to random chance. The word "significant" is so loaded with assumed meaning that many scientists never use it EXCEPT when describing the results of statistical tests. 

## Vocabulary Is a Hurdle for New Scientific Writers
In helping students learn to write, we regularly see them get hung up on specialized terms in one of three ways.

1. They use the wrong word or phrase to describe a step they did in their experiment. An example would be using "positive control group" when they mean "the experimental treatment group." 
2. They insert a specific word or phrase because it "sounds scientific," not because it is the appropriate term. An example would be -------
3. They use a word or phrase, but the context is not right. An example would be -------


## Vocabulary "Watch-Outs"
The terms defined below are called "watch-outs" because they have specific meanings, they come up regularly in scientific writing, and we often see students using them incorrectly. Your instructor may add other "watch-out" terms that they see misused regularly. Don't avoid these terms, just take extra care to use them correctly. 

### Terms Describing Groups Within an Experiment

__Control (group)__: A control group is one used to determine what is normal for the study organism or system. We usually use this term as part of a comparison with the treatment group.
 
In our experience the word "control" gives more students trouble than almost any other. Part of the problem is that we use the word "control" too loosely. There are different types of control groups, but we often do not say which one we are referring to. One way to avoid confusion is to never just say "control," but rather say WHICH control group you mean.

__Negative control (group)__: A set of samples or replicates that you KNOW should not react or give a measurable result. They provide a baseline or background for the experiment. 

When the experiment is using an assay of some kind, the negative control usually is a sample that has all of the components needed except one for the reaction being measured.

__Positive control (group)__: A set of samples or replicates that you know WILL react or give a measurable result. 

Positive controls provide confirmation that the methods of analysis are working correctly. When the experiment is using an assay of some kind, the positive control usually is a sample that has all of the components needed for the reaction being measured, plus a sample that is known to have the substance being measured. 

__Test, treatment, experimental (group)__: The group that received a treatment or experimental intervention. 

__Replicates__: Repeated versions of the same treatment, or repeated controls. 

When we perform experiments, we want to have some confidence that the results we observe are not due to random chance, and that the observations are due to the variable we wanted to test rather than some other factor. A well-designed experiment takes this into account by having replicates. 

Replicates get students into trouble because there are two kinds: experimental and technical. __Experimental replicates__ are independent repeats of the experimental test. __Technical replicates__ are not true replicates of the experimental group; they are repeated samples from one group. 

Let's put this all together. Imagine we are running an enzyme assay with 12 tubes. All tubes get 4 mL of buffer and substrate. Tubes 1-3 get no enzyme added, Tubes 4-6 get 1 drop of unknown enzyme solution each, Tubes 7-9 get 3 drops of unknown enzyme solution each, and Tubes 10-12 get 3 drops of a known active enzyme solution each. In this example:

* Tubes 1-3 are the negative control group. There are 3 replicate tubes.
* Tubes 4-6 are the first experimental group. There are 3 replicates.
* Tubes 7-9 are the second experimental group, again with 3 replicates.
* Tubes 10-12 are the positive control group.  

We use a colorimeter to measure the amount of yellow product produced by enzyme activity after 10 minutes. We measure Tube 1, then 2, then 3. We then go back and measure each tube a SECOND time. Each tube was prepared separately, but following the same procedure, so we call Tubes 1-3 experimental replicates. When we measure the same replicate more than once, we call those measurements technical replicates. 

Technical replicates are used to make sure that we are measuring our samples accurately. The first and second measurements are not independent of each other, which is why we cannot call them experimental replicates. The three sample tubes are independent from one another, so we can call them experimental replicates. 

The difference between technical and experimental replicates will be important when we talk about how to report summary data and perform statistical analyses.


### Terms Describing Types of Data

__Raw data__: 

__Summary or aggregate data__: 

__Transformed data__:

Going back to our enzyme assay in the previous section, 


### Terms Describing Types of Evidence

__Anecdotal vs. empirical evidence__: 


__Qualitative vs. quantitative evidence__:
