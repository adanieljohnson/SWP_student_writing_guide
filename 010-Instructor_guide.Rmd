# Instructors' Guide {-}

The SWP Writing Guide is for biology instructors who teach scientific writing to undergraduates or supervise teaching assistants who do. The Guide focuses on how to write a lab report that models a journal article because the same components are used in other forms of scientific communication too. Format and style recommendations generally follow the Council of Science Editors (8e) standards, with some revisions that make writing easier for students just starting out. We have intentionally avoided overly specific requirements for reasons explained shortly. 

This Guide is not designed to meet the needs of every possible audience. No one source can be that comprehensive and still be accessible to an undergraduate audience. Instead we crafted a general framework that instructors can download under the terms of a Creative Commons license, then edit to fit their local needs and requirements. 


## What Do We Mean By Scientific Writing {-}

__Scientific writing__ is not the same as technical writing like we would see in instruction manuals for instruments. It is the type of writing that scientists do nearly every day. The goal of scientific writing is to make an argument which convinces readers that the writer is asking an important (or at least interesting) question, and has some interesting insights related to that question.

This genre of writing follows organizational rules and conventions that tell writers what is expected of them, and lets readers find information they need more efficiently. Usually the writer starts by introducing their question and providing some context for thinking about the question. Next the writer outlines the methods and materials they used to probe their question and reports their results in a standard format. In the next part, the writer makes one or more claims related to that question, then used their own findings and other published evidence to support the claim(s). 



## What Assumptions Did We Make in This Guide?  {-}

We want new scientific writers to feel confident that they know WHAT the goals are, HOW to get there, and WHY those goals are important. We hear over and over from our students, "why can't I do it the way I learned before in 'X'?" We found that when we explain the logic behind certain key elements, the format makes more sense and becomes easier for students to master. It is easy to go overboard though. We recommend adjusting the "why" elements of this Guide based on the commonly repeated questions of your local students. 


Overly strict rules get in the way of learning to write like a scientist. We try to avoid requirements that are not essential to learning to write well. 



## Heresies {-}
When we first took a research-centered approach to lab report collection and assessment, one of our earliest discoveries was that some traditional writing conventions simply did not bear up to close scrutiny. 

We have aimed to reduce the number of arbitrary rules and requirements so that students can focus first on the key elements of writing as a means of communication and argumentation. 

Not all writing instructors will agree with our approach. We invite healthy debate and discussion, and anyone who wants to change the text for their students is welcome to do so by forking it on GitHub.

Global and structural flaws are more important for students to correct. Copy-editing and format are not important for novice writers to focus on.
